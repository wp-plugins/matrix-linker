Include text link units on your web pages in order to gain links from other websites for search engine ranking benefits.

== Description ==

This plugin facilitates interlinking between websites for search engine ranking benefits.

A sidebar widget is used to display a link unit containing a list of links (currently 5) to other approved website URLs using the system. The blogger gets to choose which blog posts (up to 10) will display the widget, and the URL of that page will be entered into the system for distribution to other websites.

All web page URLs will be manually approved for quality before being accepted into the system.

The "system" is the back end server plus admin and database at: http://www.matrixlinker.com

== Installation ==

1. Upload the unzipped `matrix-linker/` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or ideally, download it and install it directly on the plugins admin page
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Position the Matrix Linker widget in the sidebar of your theme through the 'Appearance', 'Widgets' menu in WordPress
1. Add/Update/Delete link units on the home page or posts/pages using the displayed admin panel in the sidebar of the blog
1. Log out to hide the admin panel in the sidebar

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the admin panel not visible? =

The web page may be cached such as by the plugin WP Super Cache. Temporarily turning off page caching while you set up your link units may solve this issue.

Also, archive pages do not display the link unit admin panel since it does not make sense to promote an archives page over other pages on your blog (unless there is a demand for this feature).

Also, you need to be logged in for the admin panel to be displayed.
